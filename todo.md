# Improvement ideas

Here is my personal todo-list.
It completes the existing ideas from the [Github issue list](https://github.com/alexylem/myphotos/issues).

- [X] Show ongoing task during library update
- [ ] Global search on album titles with instant propositions
- [ ] Smart albums: tag photos to see them grouped in virtual albums from homepage
- [ ] Local favorites: people can locally mark pictures as favorites and download them all in a zip
- [X] Possibility to order albums by title or newest first
- [ ] Don't compte/use file list, only myphoto.json->hidden + use service-side cache at album level
- [ ] Fix remaining time calculation on resumes - make it client side?
- [ ] Reset library / album if for example image quality setting is changed
- [ ] Optimize using dev tools (ex: minifiy..)
- [ ] Show icon titles in mobile mode
